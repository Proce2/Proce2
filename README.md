## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a developer with a background in Industrial Engineering who got into coding driven by curiosity and stayed because of all the benefits it brings â€” from creating tools that solve everyday problems to serving real needs in professional environments.


## ðŸš€ About Me

I started with backend and data, learning the fundamentals of Python.  
Then I got into front-end work, building e-commerce UIs to make online shopping smooth and simple.  
Right now, Iâ€™m focusing on cloud systems and how AI agents can augment developer tasks.
