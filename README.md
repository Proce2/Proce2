# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a developer with a background in Industrial Engineering. Currently working on cloud systems â€” and in my free time, I build small tools that help with everyday tasks: automating bookmarks, customizing PowerShell prompts, organizing files, or building location-aware apps based on real needs.

## ðŸš€ About My Journey

I began by learning backend development and data manipulation, diving into Python to automate small daily tasks and organize information between different systems.

Then I transitioned into front-end work, building responsive e-commerce interfaces to make online shopping straightforward and enjoyable, initially for my own use and personal projects.

Later, I moved into cloud workflows, creating systems that connect platforms, automate repetitive tasks, and improve how work gets done.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Actively Exploring

- Staying up to date with the latest frameworks, developer tools, and databases â€” always looking for better ways to build  
- Continuously refining prompts and learning how to use AI tools effectively in day-to-day development workflows
