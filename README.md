# 🧑‍💻 David J. 

I'm a software engineer with a background in Industrial Engineering. I've had the chance to work in different areas of software development across small and mid-sized companies, which helped me explore a variety of tools and workflows.

### 🚀 About Me

* I enjoy building tools that improve how I work and help with daily tasks.
* I'm driven by curiosity. I like understanding how code works at a deep level and how everything fits together.
* I’ve worked on frontend and backend development using both code and no-code tools.

### 🌱 Currently Exploring

* I'm exploring how AI and agents are changing the developer experience in how software is built
