Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm a software engineer with a background in Industrial Engineering. I work across a variety of tech tools. I enjoy building small tools that improve my day-to-day tasks and the way I work.

#### ðŸš€ About My Journey

I started with curiosity. I wanted to deeply understand how code works. That interest led me into programming fundamentals and the underlying logic at every level.

Later, I had a project where I worked with backend systems, which in turn helped me see this side of software development more clearly in a professional setting.

More recently, Iâ€™ve been applying what Iâ€™ve learned in areas related to interfaces and data handling.

#### ðŸŒ± What I'm Actively Exploring

I follow the latest updates in frameworks and developer tools that help me improve the way I work. I'm exploring how AI and agents are changing the developer experience in how software is built, maintained, and delivered.
