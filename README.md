## 🚀 About My Journey

I began by learning backend development and data manipulation, diving into Python to automate small daily tasks and organize information between different systems.

Then I transitioned into front-end work, building responsive e-commerce interfaces to make online shopping straightforward and enjoyable, initially for my own use and personal projects.

Today, my primary focus is on cloud automation and creating systems that seamlessly connect platforms, reducing repetitive manual work.
